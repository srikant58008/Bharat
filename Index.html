            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The current face of Education in the nation is actually turning out to
                be a major “silent hindrance” for India’s track to greater development. While all the attention is on
                social-political issues, it should quickly be turned on to educational reforms. Education has the power
                to all solve issues(wars, unemployment, waste management, corruption etc), in the long run, and a must
                for a developing country like India it cannot be ignored, not to say it is being ignored, India spends a
                lot of Education( somewhat only 2nd after defence), the results aren’t actually visible….
                We need to completely revamp the system of education. Focus on work experience and adapting to a
                21st-century skill set should be on the key agenda list…

                For this, the first step is reducing the burden on kids by deleting stuff from the syllabus, which
                almost 90% is irrelevant and students actually forget sooner or later and should be replaced with a
                practical and solution-centric approach to studies which will develop thinkers and leaders of tomorrow.

                I think the govt. is trying hard on this but it still needs to be passed quickly by the houses or else
                it might turn out to be too late.

                Practical oriented curriculum for all subjects could also be considered.

                Also, in the +2 scheme students should be very well allowed to study different subjects from any stream
                because in the 21st century no subject will survive in isolation, it is very much integrated hence no
                boundaries of ‘Stream’ should prevail…

                For example, financial technologies or biotechnology or behavioural economics, all are major upcoming
                fields from different subject specializations.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">For years, India has focused on improving access to schools. Haryana, a
                state in northern India, has been successful in expanding accessibility to match the national average.
                In the process, however, academic quality has not been adequately addressed.

                Although 99% of the 4.5 million school-eligible children are now enrolled in the state’s 15,000 public
                and 5,000 private schools, this access and attendance hasn’t always translated into actual learning.
                Students were consistently underperforming on national standardized tests, and more than half of the
                children in class V couldn’t read at even the class II level. The state initiated more than 40 pilot
                projects—run by different organizations—in an attempt to affect systemic change and improve academic
                outcomes. Yet all of these were too limited in scope and scale to achieve any real impact.

                In 2013, BCG was asked to diagnose the problem and help Haryana officials implement a comprehensive and
                transformative roadmap for change. By early 2014, we had begun designing and implementing Haryana’s
                Quality Improvement Programme (QIP). Our team brought about radically different results because we

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">In today's advanced technology and digitalization era, e-learning is a
                boon and plays a vital role in the development of an individual as well as the future of the nation. The
                impact of advanced technology has witnessed the shift from conventional learning methods to e-learning
                methods.

                E-learning is considered as a revolution which is breaking various educational barriers, is highly
                beneficial for the intellectual growth of an individual and helps in generating an intellectual society.
                The change in the education system and learning methods is necessary because time has evolved, what was
                relevant earlier might not be equivalent today. Various challenges in conventional learning methods
                which are repetitive, costly, limited to the classrooms, fixed timing and fixed concept for learning,
                can be overcome through the latest e-learning trends.

                In the country, where traditional higher education may not be possible for all due to financial,
                personal or any other constraints, the e-learning method/platform can act as a support system to the
                education industry. Today, India has the latest e-learning trends in the education industry that are
                being used by developed countries from a very long period. Some of them are Distance education (Postal,
                Radio, TV), E-Learning, Gamification, Open Educational Resources (OER), Cloud-based e-Learning, Big Data
                in e-Learning, Massive Open Online Courses, Microlearning, Mobile Learning etc. </p>
